Marketing Research Team:
  - I would like be able to present three or possibly more product options for the participant to choose from.
  - We would like the participant to have the ability to choose one of these presented options, so we can tell which is their favorite of the three.
  - We would like to to see a compiled total of the results so that at the end we can easily see the ratio of # of clicks/times shown for each product.
  - Images displayed should have the same properties like size, so that that these do not have any influence on the participants choice.


Developer:
- I would like to have three images displayed very visibly for the participant to interact with.
- I would like to ensure there are no repeats in the three images presented.
- I would like to ensure that image choices are not shown two times in a row between selections.
- I would like the results (number of clicks, percentage of chosen) to be displayed only after the participant has gone through the process 25 times.


Focus Group Participant:
- I want it to be very easy to know what it is, I am supposed to do.
- I want selecting my choice to be as easy as a single click of the button.
- I would also like to see an overall tally of my choices at the end of my selection process.
- I would like an easy to navigate website, organized with the standard layouts of the web (nothing crazy or new that I have to spend anyt amount of time, familiarizing myself with, should be intuitive).
